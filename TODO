- Define python:format_status/2 to eliminate errors with big binary messages?

- Add publish/subscribe mode with direct messaging support?

- Add 'threaded' mode for switch and run switch call in threads in Python. What
  is the use case for this mode? Threads:

  - Receive thread
  - Call Python thread
  - Call Erlang threads. We can use round-robin to send messages through Erlang
    call threads.

- Add custom encode/decode handlers in Erlang

- Convert Python tests from doctests to unittest

- If port was closed and we have an error to report we can try to report it
  with logging module

- Check exports in erlport/__init__.py

- Comments for modules

- How to handle Python <-> Python exceptions? We can pass it inside some error
  term. Errors/exceptions should be like opaque types marked with the language
  but store some known structures as values

- Check default port options on Windows

- Maybe force strings with {string, String} and {struct, Dict}? It can be done
  with pluggable encoder/decoder. We can add 'reach' encoder/decoder plugin
  functions

- Support argparse instead of optparse on Python 3?

- Python 3, other languages? Ruby? What about different Ruby versions?

- Add worker_pool module with pluggable workers selection policies

- Maybe we can try variable length length field as in Twisted Banana/Protocol
  Buffers protocols?
